### Migration Notes
For existing deployments:
1. Backup your database before updating
2. Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=MultiOrganizationSeeder`
3. Update frontend API calls: change all `/api/tenants` to `/api/organizations`
4. Update parameter names: `tenant_id` → `organization_id`
5. Clear Laravel caches: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear`

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added

#### Database
- Added `is_super_admin` boolean field to `users` table (default: false)
- Support for global roles with `organization_id = null` (schema already supported)
- Support for global permissions with `organization_id = null` (schema already supported)

#### Models & Methods
- Added `is_super_admin` to User model's `$fillable` and `casts()`
- Added `isSuperAdmin()` helper method to User model

#### Controllers - Authorization
- **RoleController**: Added super admin check for creating/updating global roles (`organization_id = null`)
- **PermissionController**: Added super admin check for creating/updating global permissions
- Both controllers now validate `organization_id` as nullable UUID
- Return 403 Forbidden when non-super-admin tries to create global entities

#### Traits - Global Entity Support
- **HasMultiOrganizationRolesAndPermissions**: Updated to automatically include global roles/permissions
  - `rolesInOrganization()`: Now includes global roles
  - `hasRoleInOrganization()`: Checks both organization-specific and global
  - `hasPermissionInOrganization()`: Checks both organization-specific and global
  - `getAllPermissionsInOrganization()`: Returns both organization-specific and global

#### Seeders
- **DatabaseSeeder**: Added super admin user creation (`superadmin@yiire.com`)

#### Documentation
- **NEW**: `docs/GLOBAL_ROLES_PERMISSIONS.md` - Comprehensive 9-section guide
- **NEW**: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical implementation details
- **NEW**: `GLOBAL_ROLES_QUICKREF.md` - Quick reference for developers
- **UPDATED**: `docs/README.md` - Added global roles section

#### API Examples
- Added Postman requests for creating global roles/permissions
- Both marked as "Super Admin Only" with proper descriptions

### Changed
- Global roles/permissions are now automatically included in all organization queries
- Unique validation on roles/permissions now considers `organization_id` context
- Super admin users can create system-wide roles/permissions

### Security
- Only super admins (`is_super_admin = true`) can create/update global roles/permissions
- API returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized global entity operations
- Controllers enforce authorization at create and update endpoints

### API Changes
- `POST /api/roles` - Now accepts optional `organization_id` (null = global, UUID = organization-scoped)
- `PUT /api/roles/{id}` - Now accepts optional `organization_id`
- `POST /api/permissions` - Now accepts optional `organization_id` (null = global, UUID = organization-scoped)
- `PUT /api/permissions/{id}` - Now accepts optional `organization_id`

### Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible - existing organization-scoped roles work unchanged
