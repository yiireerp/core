```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
php artisan test
```

### Database

- Always use migrations for schema changes
- Never modify existing migrations
- Provide both `up()` and `down()` methods
- Use descriptive migration names

### API Design

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Document all endpoints

## Pull Request Process
